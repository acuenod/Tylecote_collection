            In 2008, the <a href="http://hist-met.org/">Historical Metallurgy Society</a>
            acquired the papers of Professor Tylecote. These are currently being catalogued by the HMS
            and are archived in Ironbridge. The notebooks include many notes on the metallurgical
            samples catalogued in this website. Digitised copies of the relevant notebooks have been made
            and are available for <a href="notebooks.php">download here</a>.<br>
