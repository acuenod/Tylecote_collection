                    This collection is mainly constituted by metallographic mounts from the estate of 
                    <b>R.F. Tylecote</b>, but it also includes <b>H.H Coghlan</b>'s and <b>G.R. Morton</b>'s collections.
                    It contains <b>over 800 metallographic mounts</b> and a small number of sectioned objects.

                This catalogue holds one record for each sample of the collection (metallographic mount or 
                sectioned object). These "sample records" directly link to records describing the objects
                from which these samples originate.<br>
                Each "object record" holds information on the find context,
                metallographic observations and chemical analysis of the objects when these were found in the
                literature.<br>
                The publications in which this information was found also each have their own database entry
                accessible directly from a link on the "object records".<br>
                <br>
                To get started you can simply type your research interests on the <a href="search_page.php">Simple
                search page</a> (eg. "Roman iron knives") or browse the object, samples or publication records on
                the <a href="browse_choice.php">Browse page</a>.<br>
                <br>
                The <a href="tables_choice.php">Advanced search and export</a> tool enables you to conveniently
                create and export tables containing selected data contained in this catalogue. For example
                you can create a table of the dimensions, hardness and chemical composition of all the palstaves
                sampled in this collection.<br>

                <h2>History of the collection</h2>
                Ronnie Tylecote is widely considered as one of the fathers of archaeometallurgy. During his
                career he studied an outstanding number of samples from many different horizons, Roman iron
                tools in Britain, Bronze Age copper ingots in Cyprus, slag and ores in Spain and the Near-East to
                cite only a few. He also carried out a number of smelting and casting experiments and analysed
                closely the products he obtained. To add to his own samples, Tylecote also acquired the collections
                of his colleagues H.H. Coghlan and G.R. Morton.<br>
                <br>
                After Tylecote's death in 1990, these collections along with Tylecote's paper archive were donated
                to the HMS. The paper archive is now catalogued and housed at the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust,
                while the metallographic collection is subject to a Memorandum of Agreement between the HMS and
                the RLAHA who is housing and managing it since the end of 2012.<br>
                <br>
                In 2013, the collection was catalogued by the RLAHA and this online catalogue was created. It has
                also already helped to support several student's projects and in particular a master's dissertation
                on the re-evaluation of the Yattendon Hoard.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Content</h2>
                The collection is currently constituted of approximately:<br>

                </div>
                - <b>525</b> metallographic mounts from <b>Tylecote's collection</b>. These include notably all the mounts used
                by him in his publication with Brian Gilmour <u>The metallography of early ferrous edge tools and
                edged weapons</u> (1986), samples collected during the expedition lead by T. Wertime in the Near-East,
                samples for the Huelva Archaeo-metallurgical Project and Timna excavations, both led by B. Rothenberg,
                work on copper ingots from Cyprus with M. Balmuth, work on metal object recovered on shipwrecks
                commissioned by the BNFL, and many others.<br>
                <br>
                - <b>250</b> metallographic mounts and a few sectioned objects from <b>H.H. Coghlan's collection</b>. These are
                almost all copper-based and represent most of the objects from the Newbury Museum sampled and 
                examined by Coghlan and published in the last 1950s and the early 1980s. In particular this
                includes many British and Irish Axes and Palstaves and all the samples from Coghlan's publication 
                on the Yattendon hoard (1970).<br>
                <br>
                - <b>50</b> slag mounts from <b>G.R. Morton's collections</b> and in particular the slag examined for his
                publication with Wingrove on Roman slag (1969) and Medieval slag (1972).<br>
                <br>
                It is hoped that more mounts will in time be added to this collection. In particular, it is planned that
                <b>B. Gilmour</b> will shortly add the other half of the samples discussed in Tylecote and Gilmour's publication
                on iron tools and weapons (see above).<br>

                </div>
                Although the RLAHA has now catalogued all the mounts of the collection, a number, in particular from
                Tylecote's collection, have not yet been identified and linked back to artefacts. Identification of
                more samples is the subject of ongoing work.<br>
                <br>
                The copper-based samples of the collection are in relatively good condition, often simply showing 
                some tarnish and few scratches. A number of the iron and steel samples on the other hand are corroded
                and the RLAHA is currently working on repolishing the samples and on progressively placing
                them in a metallographic cabinet with controlled humidity. It is hoped that in time most of
                the mounts can be re-prepared and re-imaged to add to the value of this archive as fully
                searchable micro-photographic resource giving a truly unique learning and research tool to
                the archaeometallurgical community.<br>
