                This is a prototype version of the catalogue.<br>
                <br>
                The collection was started in 2013 with the acquisition of Ronnie Tylecote's collection of metallographic mounts.
                These mounts are subject to a Memorandum of Agreement between the Historical Metallurgy Society (HMS) and the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art (RLAHA) at Oxford University who are housing and managing it for HMS. <br>
                Coghlan's mounts and objects sections were also added to the collection.<br>
                <br>
                This catalogue is meant to act as a lerning and research collection on ancient metallurgy. In the future it will be augmented with B. Gilmour's metallurgical mounts and perhaps others.
